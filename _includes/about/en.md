Currently, I am an algorithm researcher in ByteDance Seed LLM team, and my main job responsibilities involve training algorithms and data mining. In 2022, I obtained Master's degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University, and in 2019, I received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Nanjing University.


#### Research Interests

My research interests focuse on machine learning and data mining methods with demonstrable theoretical foundations. Meanwhile, I am passionate about efficient deep learning training strategies. Therefore, my main research areas cover the following topics:

- Exploration of training optimization and training methods
- High-quality training data mining
- Data distribution shift on deep learning
- The integration of fundamental theories of machine learning with ultra-large-scale training
- Reasoning ability of LLM/VLM and its generalization
